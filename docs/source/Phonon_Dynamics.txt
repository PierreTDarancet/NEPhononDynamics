Welcome to Phonon_Dynamics's documentation!
===========================================

This code simulates the time-evolutions of phonons in contact with (non-equilibrium) charge carriers (electrons/holes). This is accomplished by solving the Boltzmann transport equation for the coupled electron-, hole- and phonon-subsystems using a direct time-stepping technique. The code can currently model this dynamics in the presence of mode-dependent 3-phonon phonon-phonon interactions and first-order electron-phonon interactions using Fermi Golden Rule. The code is interfaced with EPW and Quantum Espresso. 

The code is divided into multiple steps:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 4

   Assembling first-principles inputs
   Finding scattering phase spaces
   Computing phonon-phonon matrix elements
   Running phonon dynamics


Running the code is achieved through running the bash file **Phonon_Dynamics_1.sh** and **Phonon_Dynamics_2.sh**. The code can run dynamics for holes, electrons, or both.


The code offers these other functionalities as well

| * Graphing the compound's bandstructure
| * Graphing the temperature decay of electrons and holes as well as the thermalization of phonons
| * Graphing phonon thermalization as a function of modes


Files Name and Role
===================

omegaq.freq: Phonon frequencies (in cm-1) read by the find_scattering_events code (no negative/imaginary frequency can be present in this file) 
phband.freq: Phonon frequencies (in meV) for plotting/analysis purpose
