Welcome to Phonon_Dynamics's documentation!
===========================================

This code simulates the time-dependent interaction of phonon among themselves as well as with "hot" charge carriers (electrons/holes). This is accomplished by using the Boltzmann transport framework to find the scattering rates of the various interactions and total cumulative energy.

The code is divided into multiple steps:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 4

   Assembling inputs
   Finding phase spaces
   Computing phonon-phonon matrix elements
   Running phonon dynamics
