Welcome to Phonon_Dynamics's documentation!
===========================================

This code simulates the time-dependent interaction of phonon among themselves as well as with "hot" charge carriers (electrons/holes). This is accomplished by using the Boltzmann transport framework to find the scattering rates of the various interactions and total cumulative energy.

The code is divided into multiple steps:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 4

   Assembling inputs
   Finding phase spaces
   Computing phonon-phonon matrix elements
   Running phonon dynamics


Running the code is acheived through running the bash file **Phonon_Dynamics_1.sh** and **Phonon_Dynamics_2.sh**. The code can run dynamics for holes, electrons, or both.


The code offers these other functionalities as well

| * Graphing the compound's bandstructure
| * Graphing the temperature decay of electrons and holes as well as the thermalization of phonons
| * Graphing phonon thermalization as a function of modes


You can read explicit details on classes and functions in the code here
